# Sense-of-Life

A simple project to play [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
on a Raspberry Pi [SenseHAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)'s
8x8 LCD matrix.

* The code randomly initializes the board, except if the `SEED` environment variable
  is found, because then it uses that to initialize (see code).
* The game is looped until the last two frames are the same (e.g. run out of cells,
  or have a static configuration), in which case the code restarts the simulation
  using the same seed if supplied, or random value
* Can press the SenseHAT joystick any time to do a restart (including new
  randomization if no seed is supplied)
* The initial setup fills the board with cells at 25% probability

The gameOfLife.py script adds joystick functionality and cycles between 7 preset colors. (Right is towards the Ethernet port)

* Middle: Resets display with new state
* Up: Speeds up display
* Down: Slows down display
* Left: Pauses or unpauses
* Right: Cycles through colors

This code gratefully reuses the Game of Life algorithm published in
[Pythonic Perambulations](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/conways-game-of-life/).
